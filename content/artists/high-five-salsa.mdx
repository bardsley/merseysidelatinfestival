Noe & Diego love dancing. It is their passion, their happy place and where they've made some of our best friendships. On top of their weekly lessons, they like to organise parties, workshops, parties, performances, charity events and trips with out students to go to local dance events. In addition, it has given us them opportunity to travel to dance festivals around the world (either for teaching our own or with our group of students), so they say they could not really hope for anything else!
