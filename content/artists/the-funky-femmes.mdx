We are ‘The Funky Femmes,’ a group of like minded women who love to share their love for Locking dance.
Most of us started out learning the dance form of ‘Locking’ off the Locking Legend Thein Aung (the Locktician) 

Locking is part of the ‘Funk Styles’ and is danced to Funk Music. It was created by Don ‘Campellock’ Campbell in the Late 60’s in Los Angeles by doing moves “wrong,” thus forming a new dance.

It consists of paces, wrist rolls, Locks and points to name a few characteristics. The scene has been quiet for a very long time, however the Funky Femmes are about to give it the attention it deserves.
