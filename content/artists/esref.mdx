Esref (pronounced 'Esh-ref') discovered his passion for salsa dancing during his travels to Latin America. His first engagement with Latin music and dance were in mid 90s and his love for it grew over the years as he watched, listened, and observed DJs in the scene; worked with them and learnt from their experience.
Esref now is a very well-known and sought after teacher & DJ (a.k.a DJ Muzu), and is renowned for his legendry and unbeatable energy! You can't not have fun at any of his classes!! As well as teaching, Esref gets invited to play the tunes in Latin dance parties, events and congresses across the UK. He is dance teacher & DJ at The Rueda Academy in Sheffield & CapriDance Wakefield, & many will also remember him from one of the most popular dance nights in UK, Parranda.
