I was born in Sao Tome and moved to Portugal when I was 8 years old.

Before I started my dance career, I used to play 3rd league for the Portuguese football team. In 2000, I found what took my mind to a different dimension all together. At a young age, I started dancing Hip hop and RnB at my local school. I later developed different styles of dance such as Breakdance, House, Afro-beats, Contemporary and Kuduro. 

It was at the tender age of 19 when I found Kizomba and I fell in love. It gave me a feeling of peace, love, excitement, sentiment and made my soul ooze with such a passion it was explosive...to the point that when I danced, it spoke many different languages that connected me to beautiful music and other people. It took me 5 years to learn how to dance Kizomba and my style is all thanks to my master: Avelino Chantre.

I moved to the UK in 2014 and decided to challenge my style and show my skill with my dance partner Sonny Varela. We were thrilled to come 1st place in the UK and 3rd international with Africa Dancar 2015. 

Kizomba has developed me in many ways and I can honestly say I am in love with every aspect of it.
