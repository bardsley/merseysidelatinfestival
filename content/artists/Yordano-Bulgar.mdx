Yordano is the fresh, Cuban energy in Oslo, a true street-dancer from Havana, who managed to become runner-up in the Cuban “So you think you can dance” competing only with the professionally trained dancers. Obviously, he was immediately snached by the most prestigious dance company in Cuba, Lizt Alfonso, right after the television show, where he has received professional training before moving to Norway in 2019.

Yordano is a quite unique and naturally talented dancer with great capacity, and we are soooo lucky to have him
