Jeray’s passion for dance began as soon as he could walk, nurtured by a culturally rich upbringing steeped in the rhythms of Cali Salsa and Colombian Folk. As he grew, he expanded his repertoire to include Ballet, Bachata, Crossbody Salsa, Hip Hop, and more, building a diverse and versatile foundation that shaped his unique style.

At 16, Jeray started teaching dance, quickly gaining recognition for his energetic and creative classes that emphasized technique and a deep connection to the music. He is focused on Fusion Bachata, blending the sensuality of traditional Bachata with his eclectic dance background, creating classes and performances that are both innovative and rooted in tradition, technique and fundamentals.

Jeray’s talents have shone on both national and international stages, including a standout performance at the Duke Festival and a collaboration with Leo and Jomante’s choreo team in Lithuania. Whether teaching or performing, Jeray continues to push the boundaries of dance
