Fadi is a man of many talents, equally at home teaching salsa or DJ-ing reggaeton.

He discovered salsa in 2002 and since then has gone on to teach and DJ throughout the UK and abroad. In a comparatively short time he has developed a proven track record in many areas and has established himself nationally and internationally. He regularly works with some of the biggest names around the world, be they DJs, singers or dancers. Fadi has worked with organisations as diverse as the Latin Collective UK, the Salsa School of Malta, Salsa Explosion, Salsology, LatinTR Turkey and WR Talent. He’s the founder of the FK dance company and the artistic director for LA RUEDA DEL MUNDO SCHOOL . And the best bit of all this? It’s only just beginning.
