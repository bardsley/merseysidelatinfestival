      We are currently in discussion with the Adelphi Hotel regarding their new
      and improved 2026 menu and new costs. We will enable the Gala Dinner as a
      separate option for every ticket if we decide to go ahead with this for
      the 2026 event.\

      \

      Enjoy a delightful three-course Gala Dinner with your friends from the
      dance community.


      Start with a tasty appetizer, followed by a main course with various
      flavorful dishes, including a vegan option. End the meal with a sweet
      dessert. There are limited places available, so make sure to book by
      midnight on 2nd November.


      This dinner adds a nice touch to the evening's festivities and offers a
      relaxed dining experience.


      **Cant wait to see you!**
